project.
### Learning new tool:
We had to learn perspective library beautiful soup because our group had never used web scraping before. For this, we used official documentation and internet videos. 
### Data cleaninig
Because the data was  uncleaned and there were unwanted columns that were useless in our research, we used Excel and PowerBI to get rid of them.
### Analysis and visuilisation
Our group members collaborates to extract crucial insight and showcase it visually appealingly.
